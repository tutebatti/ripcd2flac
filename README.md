# ripcd2flac

Facilitates digitizing/ripping your music CD collection to flac files.

Insert CD in drive. Execute script. Tracks are converted to flac files in a folder disc-n, n being the next higher number. CD is automatically ejected.

If repeated, the next CD's tracks are put in new folder disc-n+1.

Later, all folders and tracks can be named and processed.
