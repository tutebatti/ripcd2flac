# ripcd2flac

Facilitates digitizing/ripping your music CD collection to flac files.

Insert CD in drive. Execute script. Tracks are converted to flac-files in new numbered folder disc-n. CD is automatically ejected.

If repeated, the next CD's tracks are put in new numbered folder disc-n+1.

All folders and tracks can later be named.
